## Hello! I am AuditeVoez, a Computer Science freshman at the University of San Carlos. 

Right now, I am focusing my studies on the `C` language.
That being said, I am still a beginner so I may not be of much help.


You can contact me through the following:
Email: 0821tenshi@gmail.com
Discord: @AuditeVoez
LINE ID: auditevoez

Fun facts about me:
- I avidly listen to Japanese music
- I am a bit goofy.
- I have over 700 hours in MHR.
